# Diagnosing-Diabetis-using-ML
Diabetis diagnostic in female patients using ML. We experimented with several algorithms.

To replicate the results we have found is pretty straightforward. 

We have included the two Python files. The only thing one needs is to import the data file, with the name diabetes.csv.
The first .py file is a detailed pre-processing, with graphical information of our dataset. All graphics have been included in the .pdf report.
The second file is the code that corresponds to the modelling part. The pre-process needed to modify the data is also included, but 
with less graphical aid. We have included seeds in the parts with a random component for the sake of reproducibility.
